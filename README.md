## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Canvas API
- **Typography:** Plus Jakarta Sans, Outfit, Fira Code
- **Hosting & CI/CD:** GitHub Pages with custom domain DNS `mathu.me`

## Fixing HTTPS for `mathu.me`

The `CNAME` file is correctly configured, but HTTPS is issued by GitHub Pages only after the
custom domain points to GitHub Pages and the certificate is provisioned. If the browser shows
"This site doesn't support a secure connection" or a certificate-name error:

1. In the repository's **Settings -> Pages**, set the source to the deployment branch and
   confirm the custom domain is exactly `mathu.me`.
2. Enable **Enforce HTTPS** after GitHub finishes certificate provisioning. If the checkbox is
   unavailable, remove and re-add the custom domain, then wait for DNS/certificate checks to
   complete.
3. At the DNS provider, use GitHub Pages records:
   - `A` records for `@`: `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`,
     `185.199.111.153`
   - `CNAME` for `www`: `Mathu-code.github.io`
4. Remove conflicting `A`, `AAAA`, URL-forwarding, or parking records. DNS should not point
   `mathu.me` to a different hosting provider.
5. Verify both `https://mathu.me` and `https://www.mathu.me` in a private browser window.

The warning in the screenshot is a server certificate/DNS mismatch, so changing HTML or
JavaScript alone cannot remove it; the GitHub Pages and DNS settings above are required.
